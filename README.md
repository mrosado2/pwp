My Personal Project

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal is very short and to the point - it specifies exactly what you want to accomplish with your site and gives info about what you want the finished site to contain. Good job here. One thing I would suggest is that you specify what kind of employer or customer you're looking for. Are you hoping to work free lance, or do you want to be employed at a small business or large development company? Keep this in mind.

Your Persona and your Use Case are a little confusing. Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal make me thing you're building a portfolio site - but your Persona and Use Case make me think you are trying to rebuild Slack. Your Persona should be, as an example, someone looking to hire a junior web developer. They go to your site, see your portfolio, and decide to call you in for an interview. From the interview, you display your skills as a web developer, and boom, you have a job!

It seems like you got the idea of the Persona and Use Case - just did not explain them using YOUR website. 

Your HTML is written very well, and your directory structure is perfect. Good job on that!

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
I'm going to have you redo this milestone - just rewrite the Persona and Use Case to something that relates back to your website. 

You did a great job overall, but I cannot allow you to proceed to milestone 2a until you rewrite those sections.

## Milestone 1 Feedback - Part 2
Your persona and use case are clear and well defined. Nice work. There are just a couple of minor errors in your HTML, so have a look at Edits &amp; Suggestions below. Overall, great work though! 

You Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Go ahead and get started on Milestone 2&alpha; ASAP.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions - Part 2
- the `<meta charset="utf-8"/>` tag is missing from your `<head>` tag.
- I suggest you remove the `<main>` tag on line 8. generally, this tag is not used inside of `<header>`





## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Great job on your wireframes. You've laid out the basic design and template of you project very well and I like the simplicity of the website that you'll be building.

Using the Bootstrap framework, developing this site should be relatively easy. Use any extra time that you have before starting development to gather images, content, and other assets that you'll be using on the site. You should also consider your design choices more carefully so you have a better starting point - plan out some color schemes, fonts, and logo options. Also, reasearch any tools you'll be using, such as image sliders.

It's a good idea to have your portfolio displayed using clickable images. From your design, it looks like you're planning on using image thumbnails to show brief examples of your work - but you should think about what's going to happen when the user clicks on one of these images. Will the full project open in another tab? Or will a Bootstrap Lightbox display information about the project? Keep this in mind during development.


For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward.

You may want to consider using an image slider for the landing image of your site. The Bootstrap framework does have an image slider included, but it's not that great. If this is a feature you're interested in having on the site, take a look at the [Flickity Slider](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/), the [Owl Carosel](http://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) or [Slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/). These are only a few of many available slider options out there, and these are mobile/touch friendly.

You could also use a Bootstrap Jumbotron - do some research on this as well.


For custom fonts, I recommend using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

When you do begin development, you'll build your page on `index.php` directly inside your `/public_html` directory.


Great job with your HTML and Directory structure! 



### Edits &amp; Suggestions
Make sure you spell the site title correctly. In the browser window, the title is "Milestome 2."

I'm assuming you're planning on having all the same content for your desktop and mobile view, so make sure that in future wireframes, you display all content for both - I notice your home page has just a landing section, while your mobile view has a Portfolio and Contact section. 

Really nice work here. Your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

## Milestone 2&beta; Feedback
I'd like to check back in with you by the beginning of next week at the latest. Your Milestone 2&beta; passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).
