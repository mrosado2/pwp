My Personal Project


## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal is very short and to the point - it specifies exactly what you want to accomplish with your site and gives info about what you want the finished site to contain. Good job here. One thing I would suggest is that you specify what kind of employer or customer you're looking for. Are you hoping to work free lance, or do you want to be employed at a small business or large development company? Keep this in mind.

Your Persona and your Use Case are a little confusing. Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal make me thing you're building a portfolio site - but your Persona and Use Case make me think you are trying to rebuild Slack. Your Persona should be, as an example, someone looking to hire a junior web developer. They go to your site, see your portfolio, and decide to call you in for an interview. From the interview, you display your skills as a web developer, and boom, you have a job!


It seems like you got the idea of the Persona and Use Case - just did not explain them using YOUR website. 



Your HTML is written very well, and your directory structure is perfect. Good job on that!



### Edits &amp; Suggestions
I'm going to have you redo this milestone - just rewrite the Persona and Use Case to something that relates back to your website. 

You did a great job overall, but I cannot allow you to proceed to milestone 2a until you rewrite those sections.
