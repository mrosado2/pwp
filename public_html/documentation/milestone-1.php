			<p>Gloria is a junior manager on the talent aquisition department at Creative Web Developers Imc.</p>

				so they won't need to get an extension on the death line.</p>
			<p>Due to the lack of time she decides to interview graduates from the Coders Bootcamps in town since they
				have hired previously from those schools and they resulted being excellent employees.</p>
			<p>She needs someone specificly with talent on the Front End, so she selects five of the candidates from the
				resumes and reviews the portfolios. </p>
			<p>Gloria likes my projects and the dynamic I use on the Front End, plus the fact that I also have experience
				working with teams, as well as my experience with sites security and organizing events.</p>
			<p>Gloria set up an interview for two other candidates and myself.</p>
